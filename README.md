## **USING CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE THE QUALITY OF RED WINE OF THE VINITO VERDE PORTUGUESE WINE**

This project aims at:

- getting insights from the data to determune the features that affect the quality of the wine 
- Developing a classification algorithm to classify the red wines based on quality 

### **DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET**

- **fixed acidity** - fixed acidity of the wine 
- **volatile acidity** - the amount of acetic acid in the wine 
- **citric acid** - amount of citric acid in the wine. It adds sweetness and flavour
- **residual sugar** - the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops 
- **chlorides** - the amount of salt in the wine 
- **free sulfur dioxide** - the free form of SO2 present in the wine
- **total sulfur dioxide** - toal amount of SO2 present in the wine 
- **density** - density of the wine
- **pH** - how acidic or basix the wine is 
- **sulphates** - amount of sulphates additives present in the wine 
- **alcohol** - the percentage of alcohol content of the wine 
- **quality** - the quality of the wine. Ranges from 0 to 10. WInes wit 7 and above are considered good wines
